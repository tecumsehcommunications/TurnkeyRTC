<h1> Turnkey RTC </h1>

<p> Bolting a webRTC server into a Starlink base station would provide, for a relatively small additional cost, secure, private and high-bandwidth peer to peer communication and data transmission between those clients connected to the same base station as well as the outside world.  </p>

<p> This repository is to provide the template for fully a functioning WebRTC service (STUN, TUN, client, server) that can easily be customized to individual preferences.</p>
