<h1> Turnkey RTC </h1>

<p> Bolting a webRTC server into a Starlink base station would provide, for a relatively small additional cost, secure, private and high bandwidth peer to peer communications and data transmissions between those clients connected to the same base station as well as the outside world.  </p>

<p> This repository will provide the template for fully a functioning WebRTC service (STUN, TUN, client, server) that can easily be customized to individual preferences.</p>
